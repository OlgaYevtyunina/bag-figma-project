    <h1 className="center">ABOUT US</h1>
    <p className="center">Our store first opened its doors in 1972 in Durban’s Beatrice Street and originally began as a shoe store that sold and repaired leather shoes to our customers. It was a small store run by my wife and myself, and we lived in the flat directly above. Combining our passion and commitment to grow our business, we soon expanded our leather range to include wallets, purses, handbags and suitcases. In the 1970s, the heart and soul of retail was found in Durban’s historic Grey Street and its surrounding avenues. Here you would find jewellers, barbers, tailors, shoemakers and other merchants at work, running their businesses that were passed down from one generation to the next.</p>
    <p className="center">Our Mission is to make a difference through our branding by staying ahead of the fashion trends, defining style and giving customers what they want.</p>
    <p className="center">Our Vision is to change the way our society connects with the fashion industry by providing our customers with products that are ethically and responsibly sourced.</p>
